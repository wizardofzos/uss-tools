Installation Instructions

1. Logon to your USS environment (via SSH not TSO OMVS lol)
2. Execute the following commands :
   - cd /path/to/where/you/want/the/scripts (or mkdir it first)
   - cp "//'THIS.PDS(ZFSMAN)'" zfsman
   - cp "//'THIS.PDS(ZFSRSZE)'" zfsresize
   - chmod +x zfsman zfsresize
   - make sure /path/to/where/you/want/the/scripts is in your PATH
3. From now you can use the zfsman and zfsresize commands as shown

Hope they're usefull!
